 * Light/dark, persisted.

 * The value is written to `<html data-app-theme>` rather than kept only in
 * React state, so the tokens in tokens.css apply to EVERYTHING including
 * portals and anything rendered outside the React tree — an embedded editor or
 * charting library injects its own chrome, and a custom property on the root
 * is the only handle that reaches it.
 *
 * The flash of the wrong theme is prevented in gatsby-ssr.tsx, which runs a
 * tiny script before the body paints. This hook only has to AGREE with what
 * that script already decided, which is why it reads the attribute rather than
 * starting from a default and correcting.
