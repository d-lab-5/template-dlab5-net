 * ADR-0002 settled that there is no anonymous access and no self-service
 * sign-up. Nothing here is fetched, no workspace is named, and the only
 * control that does anything is the sign-in form passed in as `children`. A
 * page that showed counts, names or a "recent activity" strip would be leaking
 * to someone who has not signed in.
 *
 * What it is NOT is a bare password box on an empty background. A visitor
 * should arrive at something that says what this is.
