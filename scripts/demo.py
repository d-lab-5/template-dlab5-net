D-LAB-5 template — the demo driver.

    python3 scripts/demo.py        (or: npm run demo)

A menu over the two things that are awkward the first time: deploying a
sandbox, and getting a user you can actually sign in as. It checks the
environment first and says what to fix rather than failing halfway through a
five-minute deploy.

Deliberately dependency-free — standard library plus the `aws` CLI, which this
workflow already requires. boto3 is NOT assumed: it is absent on a stock
Ubuntu, and a demo script that opens with `pip install` is not a demo.

Nothing here is used by the app. Deleting this file costs you the convenience
and nothing else.

# -- the demo account --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Both of these differ slightly from "demo-user / demo-user$1", and both for a
# reason Cognito enforces rather than a preference:
#
#   The USERNAME must be an email. auth/resource.ts uses `loginWith: { email }`,
#   which makes email the pool's username attribute — Cognito then rejects any
#   username that is not one. example.com is reserved by RFC 2606 precisely for
#   this, and the invitation mail is suppressed anyway.
#
#   The PASSWORD needs an uppercase letter. defineAuth sets no password policy,
#   so Cognito's own default applies: at least 8 characters with an uppercase,
#   a lowercase, a number and a symbol. "demo-user$1" has every one of those
#   except the uppercase, so the capital D is the whole difference.
#
# Relaxing the pool's policy to fit the password would have been the other way
# to solve it, and it would weaken the template permanently to save one
# keystroke in a demo.
