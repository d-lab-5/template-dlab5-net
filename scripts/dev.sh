# no outputs, and renders the "backend not configured" notice for the rest of
# the session. It looks like a broken build and is only a race.
#
# So: the sandbox goes first, this script waits for the outputs to land, copies
# them into the site, and only then starts Gatsby. It keeps copying, because
# every redeploy rewrites the file and Gatsby needs to see the new one.
#
# Ctrl-C stops both. The sandbox itself is NOT deleted — it is meant to outlive
# a dev session. Delete it deliberately with:

#

#   3. the [default] profile in ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config
#   4. SSO, then the EC2/ECS instance role
#
# Which means the account is whatever your shell is already pointing at. That
# is convenient and it is exactly how someone deploys a sandbox into
# production by accident, so this prints the account and region and makes you
# look at them before anything is created.

# control off is not already a group leader — so the pid we captured is the
# group leader. If anyone adds `set -m` to this script, that stops being true.)
#
# The sync watcher is a plain background subshell. It is NOT a group leader, so
# `kill -- -$pid` fails against it and the loop runs forever — verified, and it
# is exactly the kind of thing that looks fine because the terminal came back.

# So: try the group, and fall back to the process and its children.
